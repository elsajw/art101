					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We were asked to explore conditionals for this lab by creating a sorting hat using JavaScript.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I knew before testing my site that there was an issue with my code, because my JavaScript file has a bright red title compared to the black fonts of the other files. In the past, this has indicated a mistake on my part. Luckily, the document seemed to draw attention to this error, pointing out that "house is declared but its value is never read." So, I believe the issue to be something with the way that the line, "newText" has been written. This is where the value of house is meant to be read. After playing around with the code and googling solutions, I was still unable to fix this. But, I do think it's something minor and doable to fix in the future, especially since I know where the issue lies.</p>
