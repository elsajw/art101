			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Subject</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab was to organize and familiarize myself with the file structure on my computer. Additionally, it included customizing and creating new index.html files. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>I didn't encounter many problems with this assignment. For my personal homepage, I struggled to change the color of the header text and background, but I solved this by navigating back to the index.html file I was working with, where I saw that it included links to two different CSS files. I had only been looking at one of these. Thus, I was able to fully customize the look of the site.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I was able to successfully create/edit multiple index.html files, including this one.
