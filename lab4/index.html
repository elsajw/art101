			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab was an introduction to pseudocoding. I created multiple lists to practice this method, including instructions on how to create a collage and to play the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some trouble making the lists I created look good on the website, but I solved this through css and by making them ordered lists in the html code. Additionally, I was confused by some of the instructions, especially those that mentioned adding materials to an html website. I've only worked on this one for Lab 4, so I hope I wasn't missing something.  </p>

	The task: Making a Collage
