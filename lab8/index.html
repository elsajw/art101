					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled a lot with this lab. I followed the instructions, but a lot of problems arose. I'm especially unsure how to get my results to show up on this website. It seems like this is something we are supposed to be doing using JQuery, but we haven't learned about that yet. Task X was not explained in depth, so I wasn't able to do it. I found this quite frustrating. As the class continues to move forward rapidly and sections are cancelled (understandably), I find myself losing a grip on the material. I was surprised when, last week, our lecture finished early and Wes spent that extra time looking at footage of the chickens rather than reviewing material. </p>
