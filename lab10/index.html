					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use JavaScript to create a working button to generate random text.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>After copy and pasting the code directly from the assignment into JavaScript, the button was not working. After using the console to type in console.log(generateRandomText) and console.log(newText), I realized that the first function was working while the second variable newText was not. After looking at the code for Wes' site and trying things out on JavaScript, I was able to make it work by adding the code for "get new fake dialogue" and "append a new div to our output div" into the click listener function itself. This solved the problem! </p>
