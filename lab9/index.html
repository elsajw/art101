					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I followed the instructions, but, initially, my buttons did not work. I copied my html, css, and js codes into jsbin in an effort to work things out. I got stuck during this stage, unsure what to type into the console to figure out what was going wrong. I understand that we can use console.log to test things out, but I was lost on what specifically to ask for a log of. However, I noticed that the buttons were appearing, they just didn't work. So, I figured out that the issue must be with the click command section, rather than the button appending section. Looking closely at the code, I tried exchanging "button-challenge" for "#challenge" and this worked! However, it still didn't change the color of my text. I figured this might be because my site-wide css was overriding the css for this specirfic lab, so I decided to take out that code and make the text bigger instead. </p>
