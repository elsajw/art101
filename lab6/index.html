					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab was an introduction to JavaScript, focusing on arrays and objects.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have too many problems with this assignment. However, I've been unable to insert an image into this site. I downloaded multiple images of a pink Ford Taurus, converted them to jpegs, and saved them to the img folder, as well as inserted them using the image tags we were taught in class. However, this still hasn't seemed to work. You can see what appears instead under the Results Header.
					</p>
					<p>Update 5/29/2024: I was able to get the image to work on the html, but not on the website. I know there's nothing wrong with the link, because I can click on it using vscode and it takes me to the correct image. I've spent a long time looking online for how to fix this, and I haven't found anything helpful. Even the lecture seemed to reiterate what I already knew. Nothing I tried was able to fix this.</p>

					<p> I was able to complete the lab, which should be linked below.</p>
