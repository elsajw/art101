					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab was an introduction to JavaScript, which focused on learning about variables. We were asked to create variables for a car, as well as this page using html and css. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For this lab, I had some trouble changing the font color in my linked js file. I was able to do this by using "div" as the selector. I wasn't sure how to use a comment block, but I was also able to figure this out using the linked example from stack overflow. </p>
